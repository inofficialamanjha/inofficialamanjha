# Hi, Namaste üëã

What He is most proud of, is building [**InCampus**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/incampus-xero-technologies/) - a startup based on providing opportunities to college students and digitalizing the campus-based experience across India. Though the startup eventually failed ( due to poor financial and business model ), he embraces the fact that they were able to work with 1,000+ students across India and build two major applications - the [**InCampus Mobile application**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.app.incampus&hl=en_IN&gl=US) and the [**InCampus Event Portal**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/incampus-xero-technologies_incampus-event-portal-activity-6831817002823282688-3sdG) and create an organization worth **1.5Crores ( $135K )** in IInd year of college.

But as they say. "We Live and We Learn" üí´

Aman is constantly thriving to become the best Development Engineer, making sure that he empowers those people working with him to share the same vision - simply, to deliver the best products. ‚ù§

Recently, having worked with [**Microsoft Corporation**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanjhaofficial/detail/treasury/position:1792377606/?entityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profileTreasuryMedia%3A(ACoAAChG6OsBUg0XDG9xNi1cOeAhUh7kP9kQGz4%2C1635463392481)&section=position%3A1792377606&treasuryCount=1) as a software engineering intern, he is currently challenging himself to become a full stack developer and has freelanced on 6 corporate projects pertaining to Software Development ( full stack ), Web Development, UI/UX Design & Social Media marketing.

After college he plans on diving deep into the tech industry, learn and relearn everything from talented and experienced Mentors working on impactful products. For the same, he is actively searching for roles at top product based companies across USA, UK & India.

Oh, apart from work, he is a boxing and MMA enthusiast with a love for experimenting on home cook recipe's. For entertainment, he loves old school hip-hop ( Tupac & Biggie are his all time favorites ), standup comedy and binge watching thriller films. üçª
